## Music Recommendation System Using Collaborative Filtering

#### Overview

The popularity of the Internet and multimedia technology has made music recommendation systems a significant research focus in the field of recommendation. Personalized music recommendation is the core of music retrieval systems, so understanding how music recommendation algorithms work is crucial. In this project, we use the MSD dataset and design two collaborative filtering models from the perspective of user preferences. The goal is to compare the prediction effectiveness of these models.

#### Model 1: Item-based Similarity

The first model calculates user preferences based on item similarity. This approach reflects users' preference behavior by capturing the likeness between different music items.

#### Model 2: SVD-based Dimensionality Reduction

The second model employs Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce the dimensionality of user data and analyze features. This method provides accurate song recommendations by examining the reduced-dimension user profiles.

#### Experiment and Evaluation

Finally, we compare and evaluate the two recommendation algorithm models to assess their performance and effectiveness. This comparison provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in the context of music recommendation systems.
